# Rutgers-NYC-Citibike-TripData

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this project is to create visualization for the NYC Citibike trip data. The project utilizes Tableau as a visualization software to work with csv files. A 
python script in jupyter notebooks was used to transform the data type of a date column. 

## Results

![Checkout Times](/01-Checkout-Times-for-Users.png "Checkout Times")
* Trip durations are right-skewed and peak around a value of 10 minutes. 

![Checkout Times by Gender](/02-Checkout-Times-by-Gender.png "Checkout Times by Gender")
* There are significantly more male bike users, at ~105k, than female users, at ~32k. The unknown values makeup a little over 5k total. 

![Trips by Weekday](/03-Trips-by-Weekday.png "Trips by Weekday")
* Peak trip times during the workweek are between 7-9a.m. and 5-6p.m. and over the weekend are spread out from 10a.m. to 6p.m.

![Trips by Gender](/04-Trips-by-Gender.png "Trips by Gender")
* Peak trip times are similar between 'Male' and 'Female' with significantly higher values for Males since their user numbers are greater.

![Trips by Gender by Weekday](/05-Trips-by-Gender-by-Weekday.png "Trips by Gender by Weekday")
* Subscribers have more usage than customers overall. There are higher values for bike usage during the weekdays and for males as previously noted. 

![August Peak Hours](/06-August-Peak-Hours.png "August Peak Hours")
* There is a bimodal distribution with peaks between 8a.m.-9a.m. and between 5p.m.-6p.m. 

![Top starting locations](/07-Top-starting-locations.png "Top starting locations")
* There are significantly more bike users in Manhattan than the other boroughs of NYC. 

## Summary

The visualizations show that there are generally more 'Male' bike users and that peak trip times are before and after the 9-5 workday and are more spread out in the late morning and afternoons on weekends. 

### Recommendations
An additional visualization could be a single map with the starting locations in blue and the ending locations in orange to see if there are isolated areas with more start or ending traffic. Also another visualization could be mapping
the number of bike trips to the birth year of users to see if there is a trend in the distribution of age of users, additionally, gender could be added to this line chart.
